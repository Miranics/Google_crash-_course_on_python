#### Built-in Functions ####

print() 
The print() function outputs a specified object to the screen. The print() function is one of the most commonly used functions in Python because it allows you to output any detail from your code.

To use the print() function, you pass the object you want to print as an argument to the function. The print() function takes in any number of arguments, separated by a comma, and prints all of 'em.

type()   
The type() function returns the data type of its argument. The type() function helps you keep track of the data types of variables to avoid errors throughout your code. 

To use it, you pass the object as an argument, and it returns its data type. It only accepts one argument. For example, you could specify type("security") or type(7).

Passing one function into another
When working with functions, you often need to pass them through print() if you want to output the data type to the screen.

str()
The str() function can be used to convert any data type to a string. The str()function takes a single argument, which is the value that you want to convert to a string. The str() function will then return a string representation of the value.

sorted()
The sorted() function sorts the components of a list. The sorted() function also works on any iterable, like a string, and returns the sorted elements in a list. By default, it sorts them in ascending order. When given an iterable that contains numbers, it sorts them from smallest to largest; this includes iterables that contain numeric data as well as iterables that contain string data beginning with numbers. An iterable that contains strings that begin with alphabetic characters will be sorted alphabetically.

The sorted() function takes an iterable, like a list or a string, as an input.

max() and min() 
The max() function returns the largest numeric input passed into it. The min() function returns the smallest numeric input passed into it.

The max() and min() functions accept arguments of either multiple numeric values or of an iterable like a list, and they return the largest or smallest value respectively.

Key takeaways
Built-in functions are powerful tools in Python that allow you to perform tasks with one simple command. The print() function prints its arguments to the screen, the type() function returns the data type of its argument, the sorted() organizes its argument, and  the min() and max() functions return the smallest and largest values of an iterable respectively.
